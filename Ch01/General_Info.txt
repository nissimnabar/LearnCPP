The work to be done by a C++ program can be split into three categories:
1) Get user input
2) Calculate values based on the user input
3) Print these values out for the user

The first and third step should, ideally, be done in the main() function. The second step is an ideal
choice for creating functions. Each function should do one, and only one, thing well.
